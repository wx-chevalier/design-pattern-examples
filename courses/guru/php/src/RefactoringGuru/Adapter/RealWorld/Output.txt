Client code is designed correctly and works with email notifications:
Sent email with title 'Website is down!' to 'developers@example.com' that says '<strong style='color:red;font-size: 50px;'>Alert!</strong> Our website is not responding. Call admins and bring it up!'.

The same client code can work with other classes via adapter:
Logged in to a slack account 'example.com'.
Posted following message into the 'Example.com Developers' chat: '#Website is down!# Alert! Our website is not responding. Call admins and bring it up!'.
