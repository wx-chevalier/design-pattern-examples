/**
 * Observer Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one
 * object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated
 * automatically.
 *
 * Note that there's a lot of different terms with similar meaning associated
 * with this pattern. Just remember that the Subject is also called the
 * Publisher and the Observer is often called the Subscriber and vice versa.
 * Also the verbs "observe", "listen" or "track" usually mean the same thing.
 */

/**
 * PHP has a couple of built-in interfaces related to the Observer pattern.
 *
 * Here's what the Subject interface looks like:
 *
 * @link http://php.net/manual/en/class.splsubject.php
 *
 *     interface SplSubject
 *     {
 *         // Attach an observer to the subject.
 *         public function attach(SplObserver $observer);
 *
 *         // Detach an observer from the subject.
 *         public function detach(SplObserver $observer);
 *
 *         // Notify all observers about an event.
 *         public function notify();
 *     }
 *
 * There's also a built-in interface for Observers:
 *
 * @link http://php.net/manual/en/class.splobserver.php
 *
 *     interface SplObserver
 *     {
 *         public function update(SplSubject $subject);
